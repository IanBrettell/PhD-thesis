# Classification of bold/shy behaviours in 5 inbred medaka lines {#Pilot-chap}

## Introduction

Humankind has long sought to understand what causes differences between the minds of individuals, and the behaviours they manifest. 

The origin of these differences resides in our genomes. The differences between any two individuals’ genomes – known as ‘variants’ – are, at the very beginning, what sets them on their unique developmental trajectories.

During the course of an organism’s development, and ongoing throughout its lifespan, the organism’s genes interact with each other and the environment, leading to the creation of a characteristic – or ‘phenotype’ – that can be measured.2
This gives rise to a central question, widely known as the ‘nature and nurture debate’: To what extent is a phenotype determined by our genes; to what extent is it determined by our environment; to what extent is it determined by an interaction between genes and environment; and to what extent is it simply random? 

An appropriate experimental design for exploring that question involves measuring the behaviour of a large group of individuals while holding either their genes or environment constant. This would allow one to infer the extent to which differences in behaviour are caused by genes, environment, and random variation. Because it would be infeasible to carry out such an experiment with humans, we are compelled to use model organisms as a proxy.
