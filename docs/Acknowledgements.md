I owe much to those have guided me through this incredible life.

To my grandparents, U.N. and Shanta, who helped raise me and continue to offer wisdom, inspiration, and laughs (in varying proportions). And to my dear Granny, Bizz, I wish you were still here.

To my dad, Richard, who instilled in us such strong values without ever imposing them, and set up the template for my scientific trajectory. Your love for the quirky And my mum, Rina, who has stuck by me through all sorts of tribulations.

To my siblings, Rohan and Vanessa, it's been amazing to watch both of you develop into such beautiful, strong people. 

To my friends -- too many to name here, but you know who you are -- you're the *best* and I love you. A special thanks to the Pembroke crew (David, Annika, Emilie, Boris, Max, Katharina, Karen and Campbell) for making my (limited) time here an absolute blast. And our Pembroke Genome Project on campus (Emilie and Luke).

To the staff of Pembroke College, you've made it feel like home. 

To John and Jenny, thank you for everything you've done for me.

To my gorgeous fiancÃ©e Charlotte, thank you for being so supportive and dragging yourself away from Bondi to come on this adventure. Your edits have been indispensable, and you have offered me respite. I look forward to continuing on our beautiful journey together.

To the wider network at EMBL and EBI, I'm so grateful that I joined the PhD program, and I've never wanted for any support or assistance.

To the Birney Research Group and our wider set of collaborators, it's been wonderful working with you, and I'm excited to see all the amazing science (or whatever else) you'll do throughout your careers. A special thank you to Tom Fitzgerald, for your constant and reassuring presence. 

To my Thesis Advisory Committee -- Virginie Uhlmann, Cornelius Gross, and Anne Ferguson-Smith -- thank you for your sage guidance throughout this process.

And finally, to the big dog himself, Ewan Birney. You've been the best supervisor I could have hoped for. Limitlessly generous and infinitely knowledgeable (from where I'm standing, at least), you're an inspiration. Thank you.
