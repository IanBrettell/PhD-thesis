# Genetic loci associated with somite development periodicity {#Somite-chap}



## Background

During the development of an embryo, somites are the earliest primitive segmental structures that form from  presomatic mesoderm cells (**PSM**) [@kimPeriodSomiteSegmentation2011]. They later differentiate into vertebrae, ribs, and skeletal muscles, thereby establishing the body's anterior-posterior axis. **Figure \@ref(fig:mouse-embryo)** depicts a number of formed somites in a 9.5-day-old mouse embryo. 

(ref:mouse-embryo) Image of a mouse embryo at day 9.5 from @gridleyLongShortIt2006, showing somites in darker colours. 

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

Somite formation occurs rhythmically and sequentially, with the time between the formation of each pair of somites referred to as the "period". The period of somite formation varies greatly between species: ~30 minutes for zebrafish, 90 minutes for chickens, 2-3 hours for mice, and 5-6 hours for humans [@hubaudSignallingDynamicsVertebrate2014; @matsudaSpeciesspecificSegmentationClock2020]. **Figure \@ref(fig:somite-seg-ali)** shows the a series of time-stamped images of somite segmentation in medaka fish, generated by Ali Seleit.

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figs/somites/ali_fish_seg_compiled} \caption{(ref:somite-seg-ali)}(\#fig:somite-seg-ali)
\end{figure}

The period of somite formation is controlled by a molecular oscillator, known as the 'segmentation clock', which drives waves of gene expression in the Notch, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and Wnt pathways, forming a signalling gradient that regresses towards the tail in concert with axis elongation [@gomezControlSegmentNumber2008]. Over the course of elongation, the wave period increases (i.e. each somite takes longer to form), and the PSM progressively shrinks until it is exhausted, eventually terminating somite formation [@gomezControlSegmentNumber2008]. 

It is not fully understood how the phase waves of the segmentation clock are intially established [@falkImagingOnsetOscillatory2022]. @matsudaSpeciesspecificSegmentationClock2020 found that period differences between mouse and human occur at the single-cell level (i.e. not due to intercellular communication), and are driven by biochemical reaction speeds - specifically, mRNA and protein degradation rates, transcription and translation delays, and intron and splicing delays. To identify the genetic basis of these biochemical differences, our collaborators Ali Seleit and Alexander Aulehla at EMBL-Heidelberg used a CRISPR-Case9 knock-in approach [@seleitEndogenousProteinTagging2021] to establish a medaka *Cab* strain with an endogenous, fluorescing reporter gene (Her7-Venus) for the oscillation signalling pathway. This method allows them to image somite formation and extract quantitative measures for segmentation clock dynamics. 

In medaka, it is known that the southern Japanese *Cab* strain and the northern Japanese *Kaga* strain have divergent somite periodicity, where *Kaga*'s tends to be faster, and *Cab*'s slower (**Figure \@ref(fig:F0-Cab-Kaga-HdrR)**). 

(ref:F0-Cab-Kaga-HdrR) Comparison of period for three inbred medaka strains (*Cab*, *Kaga* and *HdrR*). Kaga's period is lower, and therefore it takes less time to form each somite than *Cab*. Figure generated by Ali Seleit.

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figs/somites/ali_period_F0_Cab_Kaga} \caption{(ref:F0-Cab-Kaga-HdrR)}(\#fig:F0-Cab-Kaga-HdrR)
\end{figure}

Our collaborators accordingly set up a one-way F2 cross experiment as described in Chapter \@ref(MIKK-F2-cross), using the reporter-carrying *Cab* strain and the *Kaga* strain as the parental F0 strains, in order to identify genetic loci associated with these differences in clock dynamics. They inter-crossed the hybrid F1 generation to create a sample of 622 F2 individuals, imaged the developing embryos of these F2 samples, and used pyBOAT [@schmalAnalysisComplexCircadian2022] to extract the oscillation features during somite development. **Figure \@ref(fig:somite-period-ali)** shows a series of raw images used by pyBOAT to track the elongation of a medaka tail during somitogenesis, with the identified posterior tip of the embryo labelled with a blue circle.

## Phenotypes of interest {#somite-phenotype}

### Somite development period

**Figure \@ref(fig:ali-somite-period-lines)** shows the period data generated by pyBOAT for this study, for 100 illustrative F2 samples over 300 minutes. The same data can be represented by boxplots as shown in **Figure \@ref(fig:ali-somite-period-box)**. I experimented with using the F2 individuals' mean period and period intercept as the phenotype of interest. The two measures are highly correlated ($Pearson's~r =$ 0.84, $p$ < 2.2x10<sup>-16</sup>), so after displaying the distributions for both measures in Figure \@ref(fig:somite-phenos), I proceed to only discuss the analysis of period intercept, as it would appear to potentially be more robust to the changes in slope that can be observed in Figure \@ref(fig:ali-somite-period-lines).

(ref:ali-somite-period-lines) PyBOAT results for 100 illustrative F2 samples, showing the period length in minutes over the course of 300 minutes. Period tends to increase over time, meaning that as the embryo develops, each successive somite takes longer to form. Figure generated by Ali Seleit.

\end{figure}

### PSM area

In the proceeding analyses, I also included a second phenotype of interest: the total size of the PSM prior to the formation of any somite segments. As the measure is simply based on the total number of pixels covered by the embryo object, I considered it to be potentially more robust than the period measurements, and therefore included it as a type of positive control for the genetic association analyses on the period phenotype. The measurements for PSM area comparing F0 *Cab* and *Kaga* strains are set out in **Figure \@ref(fig:ali-psm-F0)**.

(ref:ali-psm-F0) Measurements of unsegmented PSM area in pixels for the F0 individuals from the *Cab* strain ($N = 19$) and *Kaga* strain ($N = 10$). *Kaga* tends to have a smaller PSM than *Cab*. Figure generated by Ali Seleit.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figs/somites/ali_PSM_Cab_Kaga} \caption{(ref:ali-psm-F0)}(\#fig:ali-psm-F0)
\end{figure}

### Comparisons between F0, F1 and F2 generations

The distributions across the F0, F1 and F2 generations are curious (**Figure \@ref(fig:somite-phenos)**). I expected to observe an F2 distribution with a similar median to the F1, and a variance that spanned across the extremes of the F0 strains. Instead, I observed that for the period phenotypes, the F2 generation had a mean that was slightly higher than the median of the higher-period F0 *Cab* strain, and many F2 samples exceed the period values in those F0 samples. Our collaborators assured me that these observations were unlikely to be caused by technical issues. The *Cab* and *Kaga* strains originate from different Japanese medaka populations (southern and northern respectively) that are understood to be at the point of speciation (see Chapter \@ref(MIKK-genomes-chap)), so this slower period may be driven by a biological incompatibility between their genomes in cases where they do not have a complete chromosome from each parent (as the F1 generation does). I nevertheless proceeded with the genetic analysis with a view to potentially discovering the reason for this unusual distribution.

(ref:somite-phenos) Comparisons between the F0, F1 and F2 generations for the three phenotypes of interest. Here, the F0 only includes *Cab* individuals. **A**: period intercept. **B**: period mean. **C**: unsegmented PSM area. $P$-values are derived from Kruskal-Wallis tests comparing the F2 individuals across microscopes. 

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figs/somites/phenotypes} \caption{(ref:somite-phenos)}(\#fig:somite-phenos)
\end{figure}

Another important issue to note is that the F2 individuals were sequenced using different microscopes, denoted as 'AU' and 'DB'. Our collaborators noticed that there was a difference between the microscopes in their temperatures of 0.7-0.8°C, translating to a 4-minute difference in the F2 means for the period intercept measure (Kruskal-Wallis = 177.97, $p$ = 1.34x10<sup>-40</sup>), and a 3.5-minute difference in the F2 means for the period mean measure (Kruskal-Wallis = 141.79, $p$ = 1.08x10<sup>-32</sup>). This difference would need to be accounted for in the downstream analysis through either adjusting the phenotype prior to running the genetic association model, or by including microscope as a covariate in the model. No significant was found for the PSM area. To resolve this difference between microscopes for the period intercept data, I elected to transform it for the F2 generation by inverse-normalising the period intercept within each microscope (**Figure \@ref(fig:invnorm-intercept)**). I then used this transformed data in the downstream analysis.

(ref:invnorm-intercept) Comparison of the period intercept phenotype data for the F2 generation before (**A**) and after (**B**) inverse-normalisation.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figs/somites/invnorm_intercept} \caption{(ref:invnorm-intercept)}(\#fig:invnorm-intercept)
\end{figure}

## Genetic sequencing data

Our collaborators extracted DNA from the F0, F1, and F2, and sequenced the F0 and F1 samples with the Illumina platform at high coverage (~26x for *Cab* and ~29x for *Kaga*), as measured by *SAMtools* [@danecekTwelveYearsSAMtools2021]. **Figure \@ref(fig:F0-coverage)** sets out the mean sequencing depth within each chromosome and across the whole genome for the *Cab* and *Kaga* F0 samples. Our collaborators then sequenced the F2 samples at low coverage (~1x), which would be sufficient to map their genotypes back to the genotypes of their parental strains (see Chapter \@ref(somite-f2-sequencing) for further details).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figs/somites/F0_coverage} \caption{(ref:F0-coverage)}(\#fig:F0-coverage)
\end{figure}

## F0 homozygosity and F1 heterozygosity

Before proceeding to map the F2 sequences to the genotypes of the F0 generation, I first investigated the levels of homozygosity in the F0 *Cab* and *Kaga* strains, as this would have an effect on the resolution of our genetic mapping. That is to say, for regions where either parent is consistently heterozygous, it would be difficult to determine the parent from which a particular F2 individual derived its chromosomes at that locus. I therefore aligned the high-coverage sequencing data for the F0 *Cab* and *Kaga* strains to the medaka *HdrR* reference (Ensembl release 104, build ASM223467v1) using *BWA-MEM2*, sorted the aligned .sam files, marked duplicate reads, and merged the paired reads with picard [@Picard2019toolkit], and indexed the .bam files with *SAMtools* [@liSequenceAlignmentMap2009]. 

To call variants, I followed the *GATK* best practices (to the extent they were applicable) [@mckennaGenomeAnalysisToolkit2010; @depristoFrameworkVariationDiscovery2011; @vanderauweraGenomicsCloudUsing2020] with *GATK*'s HaplotypeCaller and GenotypeGVCFs tools [@poplinScalingAccurateGenetic2018], then merged all calls into a single .vcf file with picard [@Picard2019toolkit]. Finally, I extracted the biallelic calls for *Cab* and *Kaga* with bcftools [@danecekTwelveYearsSAMtools2021], counted the number of SNPs within non-overlapping, 5-kb bins, and calculated the proportion of SNPs within each bin that were homozgyous. 

**Figure \@ref(fig:somite-f0-cab)** is a circos plot generated with circlize [@guCirclizeImplementsEnhances2014] for the *Cab* F0 strain used in this experiment, featuring the proportion of homozygous SNPs per 5-kb bin (*green*), and the total number of SNPs in each bin (*yellow*). As expected for a strain that has been inbred for over 10 generations, the mean homozygosity for this strain is high, with a mean proportion of homozygosity across all bins of 83%. 

(ref:somite-f0-cab) Proportion of homozygous SNPs within 5 kb bins in the *Cab* F0 generation genome (green), and number of SNPs in each bin (yellow).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figs/somites/Cab} \caption{(ref:somite-f0-cab)}(\#fig:somite-f0-cab)
\end{figure}

However, the levels of homozygosity in the *Kaga* strain used in this experiment was far lower, with a mean homozygosity across all bins of only 31%. This was a surprise, as it is an established strain of X generations, and we therefore expected the level of homozygosity to be commensurate with that observed in the *Cab* strain. 

(ref:somite-f0-kaga) Proportion of homozygous SNPs within 5 kb bins in the *Kaga* F0 generation genome (red), and number of SNPs in each bin (yellow).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figs/somites/Kaga} \caption{(ref:somite-f0-kaga)}(\#fig:somite-f0-kaga)
\end{figure}

To determine whether the low levels of observed homozygosity in Kaga was affected by its alignments to the southern Japanese *HdrR* reference, we also aligned the F0 samples to the northern Japanese *HNI* reference (**Figure \@ref(fig:somite-f0-kaga-hni)**. This did not make differences to the levels of observed homozygosity in either sample, which gave us confidence that the low homozygosity observed in *Kaga* was not driven by reference bias. 

(ref:somite-f0-kaga-hni) Proportion of homozygous SNPs within 5 kb bins in the *Kaga* F0 generation genome when aligned to the *HNI* reference (red), and number of SNPs in each bin (yellow).

\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figs/somites/Kaga_HNI} \caption{(ref:somite-f0-kaga-hni)}(\#fig:somite-f0-kaga-hni)
\end{figure}

## F1 homozygosity {#f1-homozygosity}

I next examined the level of heterozygosity in the F1 generation from the *Cab*-*Kaga* cross. **Figure \@ref(fig:somite-f1)** shows the level of heterozygosity across the genome of the F1 hybrid in brown measured by the proportion of heterozygous SNPs within 5-kb bins (brown), and the number of SNPs in each bin (yellow). Approximately half the chromosomes show inconsistent heterozygosity, with a mean heterozygosity across all bins of 67%. This lower level of heterozygosity than expected was likely caused by the low levels of heterozygosity in the *Kaga* F0 parent. 

(ref:somite-f1) Proportion of heterozygous SNPs within 5 kb bins in the *Cab*-*Kaga* F1 cross (brown), and number of SNPs in each bin (yellow).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figs/somites/F1} \caption{(ref:somite-f1)}(\#fig:somite-f1)
\end{figure}

For the purpose of mapping the F2 sample sequences to the genomes of their parental strains, I selected only biallelic SNPs that were homozygous-divergent in the F0 generation (i.e. homozygous reference allele in *Cab* and homozygous alternative allele in *Kaga* or vice versa) *and* heterozygous in the F1 generation. The number of SNPs that met these criteria per chromosome are set out in **Figure \@ref(fig:snp-counts-per-chrom)**. 

(ref:snp-counts-per-chrom) Number of SNPs per chromosome that were homozygous-divergent in the F0 *Cab* and *Kaga* generations, and heterozygous in the F1 generation.

\end{figure}

## F2 genotyping {#somite-f2-sequencing}

To maximise the efficiency of our sequencing runs, our collaborators "shallow-sequenced" the F2 generation with the short-read Illumina platform at a depth of ~1x. We then aligned these sequences to the *HdrR* reference with BWA-MEM2 [@vasimuddinEfficientArchitectureawareAcceleration2019], sorted the reads and marked duplicates with Picard [@Picard2019toolkit], then indexed the resulting BAM files with samtools [@danecekTwelveYearsSAMtools2021]. Genotyping these shallow sequences with the same method as used for the high-coverage sequences for the F0 and F1 generation would be inappropriate. We therefore used a different method whereby we used *bam-readcount* [@khannaBamreadcountRapidGeneration2022] to count the reads that supported either the *Cab* or the *Kaga* allele for all SNPs that met the criteria described above in section \@ref(f1-homozygosity), summed the read counts within 5 kb blocks, and calculated the frequency of reads within each bin that supported the *Kaga* allele. This generated a value for each bin between 0 and 1, where 0 signified that all reads within that bin supported the *Cab* allele, and 1 signified that all reads within that bin supported the *Kaga* allele. Bins containing no reads were imputed with a value of 0.5. 

I then used these values for all F2 individuals as the input to a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with the software package *hmmlearn* [@HmmlearnHmmlearn2022], which I applied to classify each bin as one of three states, with state 0 corresponding to homozygous-*Cab*, 1 corresponding to heterozygous, and 2 corresponding to homozygous-*Kaga*. 
Across each chromosome of every sample, the output of the HMM was expected to produce a sequence of states. Based on previous biological knowledge that crossover events occur on average less than once per chromosome [@haenelMetaanalysisChromosomescaleCrossover2018] (see **Figure \@ref(fig:zebrafish-co-per-chrom)** for the average crossover rates per chromosome in zebrafish), I expected to observe the same state persisting for long stretches of the chromosome, only changing to another state between 0 and 3 times, and rarely more. 



(ref:zebrafish-co-per-chrom) Crossovers per chromosome based on data provided in @haenelMetaanalysisChromosomescaleCrossover2018, where "crossovers per chromosome" for each chromosome $c$ was calculated by $\frac{crossover~rate_{c}(cM / Mb) \times length_{c}(Mb)} {100}$. The medaka genome is shorter in length than zebrafish genome (~800 Mb compared to ~1,300 Mb), which according to the authors would suggest that medaka likely has a higher average crossover rate than what is presented in this figure.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{05-somites_files/figure-latex/zebrafish-co-per-chrom-1} \caption{(ref:zebrafish-co-per-chrom)}(\#fig:zebrafish-co-per-chrom)
\end{figure}


**Figure @\ref(fig:hmm-standard)** shows how adjusting the HMM parameters changed the called genotypes for 10 F2 samples on chromosome 18. Allowing the HMM to train itself for the transition probabilities and emission variances, the HMM produced an apparently noisy output (**Figure @\ref(fig:hmm-standard)A**). Fixing the transition probabilities to make it very likely for a state to transition back to itself rather than to another state.

(ref:hmm-standard) HMM states called for each bin across chr18 for 10 F2 samples. States 0, 1, and 2 correspond to homozygous *Cab*, heterozygous, and homozygous *Kaga*. Each point represents a 5-kb bin. Y-axis is the proportion of reads within each bin that align to the *Kaga* allele. X-axis is the bp location of the start of each bin. **A**: Standard HMM with all model parameters trained on the data. **B**. HMM with fixed transition probabilities of 0→0 or 1→1 or 2→2 = 0.999; 0→1 or 2→1 = 0.00066; 0→2 or 2→0 = 0.000333; 1→0 or 1→2 = 0.0005. **C**-**F** retain those transition probabilities but with different fixed emission variances of 0.01 (**C**), 0.33 (**D**), 0.8 (**E**), and 1 (**F**). 

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{figs/somites/scatter_collage} \caption{(ref:hmm-standard)}(\#fig:hmm-scatter-diagnoses)
\end{figure}

I used these genotype-block calls to generate the recombination karyoplots shown in **Figures \@ref(fig:karyo-wi-missing)** and **\@ref(fig:karyo-no-missing)**. 

(ref:karyo-wi-missing) Recombination blocks in 622 F2 samples based on the ratio of reads mapping to either the *Cab* or *Kaga* allele within 5-kb bins, with homozygous-*Cab* blocks in green, heterozoygous blocks in navy blue, and homozygous *Kaga* blocks in red. Most blocks show 0-2 crossover events, as expected, with some regions showing higher numbers of crossovers interpreted as noise. Unfilled regions are those with no state called by the HMM due to a lack of reads mapping to SNPs within those 5-kb bins.

\end{figure}

**Figure \@ref(fig:prop-sites-total)** shows the proportion of 5-kb bins called as either homozygous-*Cab*, heterozygous, or homozygous-*Kaga* within each F2 sample (points). The ordinary expectation for the ratios would be 0.25, 0.5, and 0.25 respectively. However, we observe a skew towards homozygous-*Cab* and away from homozygous *Kaga*. This may have been caused by the low homozygosity observed in *Kaga*.

\end{figure}

## Genome-wide linkage anlaysis

Finally, I used the called recombination blocks as pseudo-SNPs in a genetic linkage analysis. To detect associations between the pseudo-SNPs and the three phenotypes of interest, I used a mixed linear model (**MLM**) as implemented in GCTA [@yangGCTAToolGenomewide2011]. That paper describes the model as follows:

$$
\textbf{y} = \textbf{X}\beta + \textbf{Wu} + \epsilon \\
var(\textbf{y}) = \textbf{V} = \textbf{WW}'\sigma^2_{u} + \textbf{I}\sigma_{\epsilon}^2
$$
Where $\textbf{y}$ is a $n$ x 1 vector of phenotypes with $n$ being the sample size, $\textbf{W}$ is a standardised genotype matrix, $\textbf{u}$ is a vector of SNP effects, and $\epsilon$ is a vector of residual effects. I additionally used the leave-one-chromosome-out implementation of GCTA's MLM, with excludes the chromosome on which the candidate SNP is located when calculating the GRM. 

As described above in \@ref(somite-phenotype), the microscope used to image the embryos (either AU or DB) differed by several degrees in heat, which likely caused differences in the measurements observed. We accordingly experimented with including microscope as a covariate, either alone or together with the genotype for the reporter locus (either homozygous or heterozygous), or excluding it altogether. In an attempt to avoid complications resulting from its inclusion, we also tried inverse-normalising the period phenotype within each microscope group, transforming the phenotype to fit a normal distribution across both microscopes. 

To set the significance threshold, I permuted the phenotype across samples using 10 different random seeds, together with all covariates when included, and ran a separate linkage model for each permutation. I then set the lowest $p$-value from all 10 permutation as the significance threshold for the non-permuted model. I additionally applied a Bonferroni correction to our $p$-values by dividing $\alpha$ (0.05) by the number of pseudo-SNPs in the model, and set this as a secondary threshold. 

### Period intercept

**Figure \@ref(fig:somite-manhattan)** is a Manhattan plot of the genetic linkage results for the period intercept phenotype, inverse-normalised across microscopes. The regions found to be significant based on the permutations' minimum $p$-value are set out in **Table \@ref(tab:somite-sig-int-tbl)**.

These regions contained a total of 46,872 SNPs imputed from the genotype of the F0 parental strains. 
I ran Ensembl's Variant Effect Predictor [@mclarenEnsemblVariantEffect2016] over these SNPs to identify those that would be most likely to have functional consequences. The full counts of SNPs falling into each category of 'consequence' are set out in **Table \@ref(tab:int-consequence-tbl)**. From this process I identified 38 genes that included a missense variant, 1 that included a missense variant and a start lost (ENSORLG00000014616), ane 1 that included a missense variant and a stop lost (ENSORLG00000015149).

Our collaborators then combined these results with bulk RNA-seq that they had performed on F0 *Cab* and *Kaga* individuals, to determine which of these genes are expressed in the tail during embryogenesis. This allowed them to reduce to the list to 29 genes, and a gene ontology analysis of this found that the list of genes was enriched for body axis, somitogenesis, and segmentation (**Table \@ref(tab:psm-final-genes)**). For this list of genes, our collaborators are now in the process of knocking in the protein-altering *Cab* allele into *Kaga* embryos, and *vice versa*, to functionally validate these variants.

### PSM area

**Figure \@ref(fig:psm-manhattan)** is a Manhattan plot of the genetic linkage results for the PSM area phenotype. The regions found to be significant based on the permutations' minimum $p$-value are set out in **Table \@ref(tab:somite-sig-psm-tbl)**, although they exceed the Bonferroni correction threshold as well. I note that this ~6 Mb significant region on chromosome 3 does not overlap at all with the significant region discovered for the period intercept phenotype. 

(ref:psm-manhattan) Manhattan plot of the genetic linkage results for the PSM area phenotype. Pseudo-SNPs with $p$-values lower than the permutation significance threshold are highlighted in yellow.

This region contained a total of 29,096 SNPs imputed from the genotype of the F0 parental strains. 
I ran Ensembl's Variant Effect Predictor [@mclarenEnsemblVariantEffect2016] over these SNPs to identify those that would be most likely to have functional consequences. The full counts of SNPs falling into each category of 'consequence' are set out in **Table \@ref(tab:psm-consequence-tbl)**. From this process I identified 114 genes that included a missense variant, and 1 that included a both a missense variant and a start lost (ENSORLG00000010863, a centriole, cilia and spindle-associated protein).

Our collaborators then combined these results with bulk RNA-seq that they had performed on F0 *Cab* and *Kaga* individuals, to determine which of these genes are expressed in the unsegmented tail during embryogenesis. This allowed them to reduce to the list to 96 genes, although they were not apparently associated with a specific gene ontology. As with the period intercept phenotype, our collaborators are now in the process of knocking in the *Cab* allele into *Kaga* embryos, and *vice versa*, to functionally validate these variants.
