## Direct genetic effects

### Tile plot

(ref:mikk-all-tile-dge) Tile plot for all 1610 test fishes included in the MIKK panel behaviour analysis, ordered by each line's group median for individual mean speed over the course of the 20-minute video (open field and novel object combined). The order of lines is identical to that shown in **Figure \@ref(fig:mikk-mean-speed)**.

### Density plot

(ref:mikk-all-dens-dge) Density plot for all 1610 test fishes included in the MIKK panel behaviour analysis, ordered by each line's group median for individual mean speed over the course of the 20-minute video (open field and novel object combined). The order of lines is identical to that shown in **Figure \@ref(fig:mikk-mean-speed)**.

## Social genetic effects

### Tile plot

(ref:mikk-all-tile-sge) Tile plot for all 1610 reference fishes included in the MIKK panel behaviour analysis, ordered by each line's group median for individual mean speed over the course of the 20-minute video (open field and novel object combined). The order of lines is identical to that shown in **Figure \@ref(fig:mikk-mean-speed)**.
