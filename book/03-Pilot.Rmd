To take advantage of the rich genetic resources offered by medaka, my collaborators (primarily the Loosli Group at KIT) and I developed a behavioural assay to examine the performance of isogenic inbred strains for an inter-strain comparative analysis of bold-shy behaviours in medaka. In this chapter I describe how I used this assay -- which combines both an "open-field" and "novel object" component with pairs for fish -- to determine: a) whether there were consistent differences in bold-shy behaviours exhibited by 5 established inbred strains of medaka fish (*iCab*, *HdrR*, and *HO5* from southern Japan, and *Kaga* and *HNI* from northern Japan); and b) whether there were consistent differences in bold-shy behaviours exhibited by a given strain (*iCab*) dependent on the strain that it was partnered with. The former was intended to measure the effect of an individual’s own genes on its behaviour (a direct genetic effect), and the latter to measure the effect of the genes of the focal fish’s tank partner on the behaviour of the focal fish (an indirect genetic effect). This experimental design allowed me to assess both direct and indirect effects on behaviour simultaneously, and to infer the degree to which variation in bold-shy behaviours is attributable to the differences in an individual’s own genetics, the differences in the genetics of their social companions, and stochastic variation. A schema for the experimental plan is shown in **Figure \@ref(fig:behavioural-schema)**.

(ref:behavioural-schema) Schema for experimental plan. *iCab*-*iCab* pairings are the control condition. To explore direct genetic effects on behaviour, I compare the behaviours of test fishes from different strains, and infer that the differences between strains are caused by the differences in their genetics (direct genetic effects). To explore indirect genetic effects, I use the same data but turn our focus to the reference fish, and infer that the differences I observe between their behaviours are caused by the differences in their social environments, which are in turn driven by the different genetics in the test fish strains (indirect genetic effects).

## Assay components

As outlined in the Introduction in section \@ref(intro-behaviour), the 'open field' and 'novel object' tests are generic paradigms for measuring boldness in a suite of model organisms.

### Open field

Although the open field test always involves introducing a test fish to a novel environment and then observing it as it moves freely, studies vary in: whether the fish is allowed to acclimate for some time prior to data collection; the duration of the test; the method of recording the data (human observation, infrared sensors, or video tracking); and the variables recorded.

Earlier studies necessarily relied on human observation. @wilsonShyboldContinuumPumpkinseed1993 observed the movement of the Pumpkinseed Sunfish (*Lepomis gibbosus*) for 30 minutes in a test tank and measured its location in a superimposed grid at 5-minute intervals. @budaevPersonalityGuppyPoecilia1997 observed the poeciliid guppy (*Poecilia reticulata*) for 5 minutes (after 2 minutes of acclimation) in a tank marked with a 10x10 cm grid on the bottom, and recorded the number of grid squares it crossed, and the total percentage of assay time that it spent moving. @bellDevelopmentBehaviouralDifferences2004 measured the behaviour of the stickleback (*Gasterosteus aculeatus*) over the course of 180 seconds, recording the number of times it moved to a different area of the tank, the total number of areas in the tank that it used, and the number of times that it moved (not necessarily to a different area of the tank). @brownCorrelationBoldnessBody2007 measured the time it took for *Brachyrhapis episcopi* to emerge from a shelter within the test tank. @matsunagaHabituationMedakaOryzias2010 observed medaka over 8 hours exploring either a large or a small tank, recording its horizontal locomotion and position, and vertical (depth) locomotion and position by dividing the tank into sections and recording its position and the instances where it crossed into another section.  

Advances in infrared sensing and computer vision permitted more automated means of tracking fish movement. @yoshidaComparisonBehavioralResponses2005 compared the behaviours of the bluegill *Lepomis macrochirus*, crucian carp *Carassius langsdorfii* and goldfish *Carassius auratus* by measuring their movements in a test tank as detected by 4 infrared beam sensors over a 120 minute test period after 30 minutes of habituation. @dahlbomBoldnessPredictsSocial2011 used video tracking software to measure boldness in zebrafish (*Danio rerio*) by recording its distance moved and the amount of time spent in the centre zone of the tank over the course of 5 minutes. @alfonsoCopingStylesEuropean2019 also used video tracking software to measure boldness in the sea bass (*Dicentrarchus labrax*) by measuring its latency to exit the shelter into a novel test tank, as well as its total distance travelled, number of transitions between shelter and arena, and the time spent in the shelter over the course of 20 minutes. @lucon-xiccatoDevelopmentOpenFieldBehaviour2020 used medaka to explore boldness at different ages by using video tracking software and an infrared camera to track its movement around a novel test tank for 30 minutes and extracted behavioural variables including distance moved, time spent moving, and time spent in the centre of the test tank. @hamiltonShoalingBoldnessAnxietylike2021 investigated boldness in the zebrafish by measuring basic locomotion and the time spent along either the walls or the centre of the tank over the course of a 10-minute trial. @lucon-xiccatoComparisonAnxietylikeSocial2022 compared the behaviours of medaka and zebrafish in an open field test by tracking their movement around a novel test tank with infrared sensors over the course of 30 minutes, measuring thigmotaxis (time spent along the wall of the tank), total distance moved, and speed.

In the aforementioned studies, the general interpretation is that lower movement latency and higher overall movement indicates greater boldness. In this study, I sought to apply an unbiased, data-driven approach to analyse recorded videos of medaka for 10 minutes immediately after being introduced to the test tank. Because I expected movement latency to be an important measure of boldness, I did not incorporate a period of acclimation in the method. I was advised by our collaborator and medaka behavioural expert, Professor Loosli, that 10 minutes was likely to be sufficient to detect differences between medaka strains in behaviour. 

### Novel object

To include an additional domain of boldness in a way that would also permit high-throughput data collection, I added a novel object paradigm to run consecutively after the initial 10-minute open field test. The novel object test has also differed in its implementation across studies, but fundamentally involves measuring the interactions of the test subject with a novel object that is introduced to the test tank. For instance, @sundstromHatcherySelectionPromotes2004 measured the number of approaches  made by brown trout (*Salmo trutta*) to a novel object (tack pin) within a 1-minute period after acclimating to the test tank overnight. @wrightQTLAnalysisBehavioral2006 used a cylindrical black plastic novel object to explore boldness in zebrafish by measuring the total time spent within 1.5 body lengths of the novel object in a 10 minute period, the time taken to first enter the novel object zone, and the number of time it entered the zone. @brownCorrelationBoldnessBody2007 used *Brachyrhapis episcopi* to measure boldness in an assay where the test fish was placed in a clear plastic cylinder in the middle of a test tank, with a pair of conspecific fish in another clear plastic cylinder on one end of the tank, and a novel object (a bright pink and yellow rubber ball) at the other. An observer measured the amount of time the test fish spent in the third of the test tank closest to the novel object. @dahlbomBoldnessPredictsSocial2011 used video tracking software to measure boldness in zebrafish by recording its distance moved and the amount of time spent in the centre zone of the tank with the novel object (a white Lego brick) over the course of 5 minutes. @hamiltonShoalingBoldnessAnxietylike2021 quantified boldness in zebrafish using a Lego figurine as the novel object and measuring total distance moved, and time spent in the centre zone of the test tank (near the novel object).

In the aforementioned studies, the general interpretation is that a higher level of boldness corresponds to a greater amount of time spent either inspecting the novel object or being proximate to it. In this study, for the novel object I used a small, black plastic cylinder similar to that used in @wrightQTLAnalysisBehavioral2006. I expected to observe differences in the latency of movement following the introduction of the novel object, and the manner in which the test subjects moved around it. As with the open field component, I sought to apply a data-driven approach by which I would classify the behaviours. I expand on these methods below.

## Data collection {#pilot-data-collection}

Our behavioural assay is 20 minutes long, comprising two consecutively-run 10-minute components: a) an ‘open field’ component, where the fishes are introduced to the test tank and left to swim around freely; and b) a ‘novel object’ component, where a small black plastic cylinder is added to the tank at the beginning of the second 10-minute period, after which the fishes are again left to swim around freely. The assay is run on pairs of fish. Medaka is a seasonal breeder in which photoperiod has a strong effect on physiology and behaviour [@lopez-olmedaLongPhotoperiodImpairs2021]. In this study I tested fish that were acclimated to summer conditions. To avoid confounding mating behaviours between males and females and associated aggressive interactions between males I used only female fish in all experiments. To increase the throughput of the assay, the test tank was divided into four quadrants with barriers, allowing me to run the assay on four pairs of fish simultaneously. In addition, I used two test tanks situated side-by-side, allowing me to run 8 assays concurrently. The experimental setup used is shown in **Figure \@ref(fig:assay-setup)**.

(ref:assay-setup) **A**: Experimental setup, with two test boxes side-by-side (denoted as “L” for left and “R” for right). Each test box contains one test tank, separated by removable barriers into quadrants, allowing for the simultaneous assay of four pairs of fish per test tank. The interior of the box is ambiently illuminated by LED lights, and a camera is suspended over the centre of each test tank to record the videos. **B**: Four pairs of fishes in a test tank with labelled quadrants (I, II, III, IV) and strains (*iCab* or *HdrR*). C: Paths of *iCab* reference fish and *HdrR* test fish from the video at panel (B) at 110 seconds.

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("book/figs/pilot/setup_pic_with_frame_110.png"), auto_pdf = T)
```

Between 11 and 16 June 2019, I assayed a total of 307 pairs of fish, comprising the following counts for each strain pairing: 68 *iCab/iCab*, 60 *iCab/HdrR*, 76 *iCab/HNI*, 47 *iCab/Kaga*, and 56 *iCab/HO5*. The locations of the strains' originating populations were shown in the Introduction chapter, **Figure \@ref(fig:line-locations)**. The fish from the iCab strain was denoted as the "reference fish", and was introduced to the test tank first. The “test fish” which was either another iCab fish (for the control condition), or a fish from one of the other four strains that were assayed in this experiment (*HdrR*, *HNI*, *Kaga*, *HO5*). The order in which the strains were assayed across the six days was randomly determined prior to the collection of the data. The test tanks were also rinsed between runs to remove any substances released by subjects during previous runs that could influence the behaviour of the subjects that followed.

## Tracking

I split the videos by quadrant and assay component, and tracked the movement of the fishes with the open-access software package *idtrackerai* [@romero-ferreroIdtrackerAiTracking2019]. Each individual fish was tracked across at least 85% of frames in each video, with 78% of videos tracked for over 99% of frames. The failure to track both fishes across all frames was usually caused by instances where a fish was situated behind the novel object or quadrant divider, rendering it invisible to the camera. I reviewed a random selection of 20 videos to search for instances of mislabeled fishes due to software errors. I found none, which is consistent with the reliability of the software as reported by its authors. I therefore concluded that such instances would be absent or very rare and thus negligible. 

To identify which fish was the reference or test fish, I could generally distinguish between the strains based on their colour, as *iCab* pigmentation is light-brown, *HO5* are light-brown with an orange hue, *HdrR* females are white, and *HNI* and *Kaga* are grey. Where the reference fish was indistinguishable in colour from the test fish, I identified the fish that was introduced to the test tank first, and followed it by eye through to the first frame of the assay. In cases of *iCab*-*iCab* pairings, I randomly assigned the individuals to either the "reference" or "test" fish. I then used the coordinates of the fishes in each frame to calculate the distance and angle travelled by each fish between a fixed time interval, for example every 0.05 seconds. Distance was calculated between points B$\rightarrow$C, and angle was calculated between points A$\rightarrow$B$\rightarrow$C. 

## Effect of covariates

I examined the effects of several covariates, including date of assay, time of assay, tank quadrant, and tank side. To achieve this, I calculated the mean speed of individuals in *iCab*-*iCab* pairings ($N$ = 136) over the course of the entire 20-minute video (including both open field and novel object assays), and ran a multi-way ANOVA with all covariates (**Figure \@ref(fig:covariate-effects)**). I found significant differences for date of assay and and tank quadrant ($p$ = 0.0139 and 0.0108), but not for time of assay or tank side. This may have been driven by a difference in the way the assay was performed on the first day of the experiment (11 June 2019), where I used a thick fabric sheet to cover the front of the box rather than the wooden doors shown in **Figure \@ref(fig:assay-setup)**, as they were only installed the following day. The greater level of external light and sound permeating through the fabric may have caused the fishes to exhibit slower movement on that first day, and when the data from that day is excluded, the $p$-values for date of assay and tank quadrant increase to 0.0477 and 0.0469 respectively.

(ref:covariate-effects) Effect of covariates on mean speed of iCab individuals when paired with another iCab over the course of the full video (including both open field and novel object assays). *P*-values were calculated from a multi-way ANOVA with all four covariates included as terms, and adjusted for false discovery rate.

## Choice of time interval and number of Hidden Markov Model (HMM) states {#pilot-hmm-params}

I next sought to convert the distance and angle of travel measures into a more biologically relevant phenotype, while taking advantage of modern computational methods that would deliver an unbiased classification of movements and produce measures that were similar to, but more accurate than, those used in previous studies (namely, overall movement and spatial locations indicating thigmotaxis and interactions -- or lack thereof -- with the novel object). Given the data is a time series, there are several methods available to achieve this, including change detection [@jonietzContinuousTrajectoryPattern2018]. Of the available methods, I selected the Hidden Markov Model (**HMM**) because it is well-suited for classifying the hidden states that generate stochastic, sequential observations, and because it learns many parameters from the data via expectation maximisation. It is nevertheless left to the researcher to decide how many HMM states to use and, in this case, the time interval between which the distance and angle of travel are calculated. To assess which combination of HMM state space and time interval would be best to use, I extracted the distance and angle measurements as input variables, and trained a number of HMMs with the *hmmlearn* Python package [@HmmlearnHmmlearn2022] on the full dataset with different combinations of a defined, fully-connected state space (either 5, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, or 20 states) and time interval (0.05, 0.08, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5 and 1 seconds). I then sought to determine the combination of these parameters that would strike the optimal balance between: a) the ability to detect differences between strains; b) a minimisation of model overfitting; and c) the retention of left-right symmetry between states that would facilitate biological interpretation.

To quantify each model's ability to detect differences between strains, I ran a Kruskal-Wallis test (a non-parametric version of Fisher's ANOVA, @hollanderNonparametricStatisticalMethods2013) for each HMM state, comparing the frequencies of time spent in that state between the five strains, and then summed the statistics over all HMM states in the given model's state space. Next, to quantify the level of overfitting by each model, I carried out a two-fold cross-validation process, where I randomly assigned the videos to either group A or group B. For each group, I computed the concordance between the states assigned by the model that was trained on itself (e.g. A), and by the model that was trained on the other dataset (e.g. B), and then calculated the mean of those two measures (concordance between A trained on A and A trained on B; and concordance between B trained on B and B trained on A).

**Figure \@ref(fig:compare-params)** sets out the comparison of different combinations of HMM state space and time interval on these two measures. The horizontal axis represents the level of overfitting ('mean concordance between cross-validated HMM states'), and the vertical axis represents the quantification of differences between strains ('summed Kruskal-Wallis statistic comparing frequency of time spent in each HMM state across medaka strains'). As expected, lower state numbers have higher concordance, but a diminished ability to distinguish between strains.
  
(ref:compare-params) Comparison between different combinations of HMM state space and time interval. Horizontal axis: Mean concordance between states assigned by HMMs through a 2-fold cross-validation process. Vertical axis: Kruskal-Wallis statistic comparing strains based on the proportion of time spent in each HMM state, summed across all states. The size of the points correspond to the interval, in seconds, between which the distance and angle of travel was calculated. The top right of the figure represents the better models, indicated by the pink arrow. The highlighted circle represents the best combination of HMM state space and time interval that also had favourable symmetrical properties (see below).

```

The most optimal combination based on these metrics was a state space of 16 and a time interval of 0.05. The distances and angles of travel for each of the 16 states are shown in **Figure \@ref(fig:pilot-polar-asym)**, generated from 10,000 randomly-selected data points (i.e. movements). Each point represents the radial distance in log~10~(pixels) that a fish travelled from its previous location (B$\rightarrow$C), and the polar angle travelled from A$\rightarrow$B $\rightarrow$C, where A$\rightarrow$B is always aligned vertically along the 0-180° axis. For example, a point at 45° far from the pole represents a fast, forward movement to the right, and a point at 260° close to the pole represents a slow, backward movement to the left. The states are ranked by mean distance, so state 1 represents slow movements in any direction, and state 8 represents faster forward movements.

Each point represents the distance and angle at point C, and A$\rightarrow$B is aligned vertically along the 0-180° radial axis. The figure shows an illustrative 10,000 data points (movements), randomly selected from the full dataset. States are sorted in ascending order by mean distance.

```

Figure \@ref(fig:pilot-polar-asym) shows an asymmetry between states 1 and 3, where state 3 appears to have been "carved" out of state 1, and to a lesser extent state 5. This asymmetry makes it difficult to interpret their biological relevance, and this phenomenon was consistent across all more-optimal combinations with 15 or more states. It may have been caused by the test subjects' preference for certain corners of the test tank, which would necessarily restrict the movement of the fish in certain directions, and this deserves further investigation. Nevertheless, for the downstream analysis I selected the combination of 14 states with a 0.08-second interval between time points (**Figure \@ref(fig:pilot-polar)**), because out of the remaining combinations it appeared to optimally balance the level of overfitting and detection of differences between strains.

```

I next sought to determine whether there was a difference in the proportion of time spent in each state between the 5 inbred strains (implying the presence of direct genetic effects), and between the *iCab* reference fishes depending on the inbred strains of their tank partner (implying the presence of indirect genetic effects).  

## Direct and indirect genetic effects on bold/shy behaviour

### Direct genetic effects

To determine whether the test fish strains differed in the proportions of time they spent in each state, I ran separate multi-way ANOVAs for each combination of assay component (open field or novel object) and state (states 1 to 14): 

$$
frequency_{A,S} = \beta_{1}(test~fish~strain) + \beta_{2}(date) + \beta_{3}(time) + \beta_{4}(quadrant) + \beta_{5}(tank~side)
$$
where $A$ = assay component (open field or novel object), and $S$ = HMM state (1 to 14).

The proportion of time each individual spent within a state was first inverse-normalised within each combination of assay and state, and the date of assay, time of assay, tank quadrant, and tank side were included as covariates. $P$-values were then adjusted for the False Discovery Rate following the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure [@benjaminiControllingFalseDiscovery1995] (**FDR**).

The states that showed a significant difference between strains are set out in **Table \@ref(tab:pilot-dge-tbl)**. The test fish strains differed significantly in the proportion of time spent in a given state ($p$ < 0.05, FDR-adjusted) for 11 out of 14 states in the open field assay (4.45x10^-24^ < $p$ < 1.06x10^-2^), and 7 out of 14 states for the novel object assay (5.53x10^-16^ < $p$ < 4.2x10^-3^), with the strain of the test fish explaining up to ~28% of the variance in the proportion of time spent in a given state. For some states, there was also a significant -- but weaker -- difference between quadrants, date of assay, and tank side (open field: 1.03x10^-9^ < $p$ < 1.18x10^-2^; novel object: 1.75x10^-8^ < $p$ < 4.9x10^-2^).

**Figure \@ref(fig:pilot-dge-time)** depicts the time dependence of HMM states over the course of the video, and the regions of the test tank that were most frequently occupied by the different strains. Figures A and H show the HMM states with panels coloured red to indicate the states that were found to significantly differ between test fish strains. **Figures \@ref(fig:pilot-dge-time)B** and **E** show how each individual test fish, grouped by inbred strain, moved through HMM states throughout the course of the video, with each tile coloured by the state most frequently-occupied by the individual within 2-second intervals. Figures **\@ref(fig:pilot-dge-time)C** and **F** show the same data, recalculated as densities within each strain, with only the states that showed significant differences between strains in colour, and the remaining states consolidated and coloured grey. There is an especially clear difference between strains in the proportions of time spent in the slowest-moving states (i.e. states 1 to 3) at the beginning of each assay component, with an increase across all strains in the novel object assay, likely as a consequence of having less room to move, as well as the fear response that the novel object was designed to elicit. The differences are clearest when comparing the southern Japanese medaka strains (*iCab*, *HdrR*, and *HO5*) against the northern Japanese strains (*Kaga* and *HNI*). In addition, I note that *Kaga* tends to spend more time in the fast- and forward-moving state 13 at the beginning of the assay than at other times, which suggests that for that strain, such movements may be the manifestation of a stress response. **Figures \@ref(fig:pilot-dge-time)D** and **G** show, as densities, the regions of the tank that were most frequently occupied by each strain. Although the northern Japanese strains *Kaga* and *HNI* were similarly fast-moving relative to the southern Japanese strains, in the open field assay component they appear to favour different regions of the tank – where *HNI* occupied the central regions of the tank with more frequency, *Kaga* tended to prefer swimming along the boundaries of the tank.

### Social genetic effects {#pilot-sge}

To determine whether the *iCab* reference fishes altered their behaviour depending on the inbred strain of their tank partner, I carried out the same analysis and model as above using only data from the *iCab* reference fishes. The states that showed a significant difference are set out in **Table \@ref(tab:pilot-sge-tbl)**. The *iCab* reference fishes differed significantly in the proportion of time they spent in a given state depending on the strain of their tank partner ($p$ < 0.05, FDR-adjusted) for 5 out of 14 states in the open field assay (2.04x10^-6^ < $p$ < 2.11x10^-2^), and 7 out of 14 states for the novel object assay (4.76x10^-7^ < $p$ < 4.06x10^-2^). The strain of the tank partner explained up to ~9% of the variance in the proportion of time the *iCab* reference spent in a given state. Full tables for all states and variables are provided in the Supplementary Material.

I observe that the proportions of time the *iCab* reference fishes spent in different states do differ based on the strains of their tank partner, and that their behavioural patterns tend to reflect those of the test fish strains they are paired with (**Figure \@ref(fig:pilot-sge-time)**). Thus, the *iCab* reference fishes spend less time in the slower-moving states when in the presence of the faster-moving northern Japanese strains *Kaga* and *HNI*, which in turn shows that the test fishes are transmitting their behaviours to some degree to their *iCab* tank partners. As expected, the differences in the behaviours of *iCab* reference fishes based on the strain of their tank partners are not as large as those between the test fish strains. However, unlike what was observed with the test fishes, here there is a greater number of states that show significant differences during the novel object component of the assay compared to the open field component. This suggests that when movement is restricted, or when in the presence of a potential threat, the behaviour of the test fish tank partner has more of an influence on the *iCab* reference fish’s behaviour than otherwise.

Finally, to develop a metric to quantify the degree to which the *iCab* reference fishes’ behaviour is influenced by the strain of its tank partner, I calculated the proportions of time that the pairs of fish spent simultaneously occupying the same HMM state. **Figure \@ref(fig:pilot-cooc-heat)** shows that when paired with the slowest-moving *HdrR* strain, the *iCab* reference fishes spent more time co-occupying the slow- and forward-moving state 2, whereas they tended to co-occupy the fast- and forward-moving state 11 when paired with the faster-moving northern *Kaga* and *HNI* strains. When paired with another *iCab*, they preferred to co-occupy the slow-moving and pan-directional state 4. For each combination of assay component and state, I then ran a Kruskal-Wallis test to determine whether there were differences in the frequencies of state co-occupancy under different strain pairings ($p$ < 0.05, FDR-adjusted), and found significant differences for states 1 to 6 for the open field component (1.1x10^-8^ < $p$ < 4.1x10^-2^), and states 1 to 4 and 7 for the novel object component (1.6x10^-6^ < $p$ < 2.5x10^-2^). The heatmaps show that *iCab* tends to co-occupy state 4 at the highest frequency when paired with another *iCab*, which suggests that this pan-directional, slow-moving state is a more comfortable or natural state for *iCab* to occupy, particularly when under stress.
