# About

Code to render PDF:

```{r, eval = F}
bookdown::render_book("book", bookdown::pdf_book())
```

Code to render PDF with different fonts:

First make the `bookdown::pdf_book:` entry in `_output.yml` first.

Then...

```{r, eval = F}
bookdown::render_book("book")
```

To clean up the references:

```{r, eval = F}
citr::tidy_bib_file(rmd_file = c("book/index.Rmd",
                                 "book/01-Introduction.Rmd",
                                 "book/02-MIKK_genome.Rmd",
                                 "book/03-Pilot.Rmd",
                                 "book/04-MIKK_F2.Rmd",
                                 "book/06-Fst.Rmd",
                                 "book/07-references.Rmd"),
                    messy_bibliography = "book/book.bib",
                    file = "book/tidy_references.bib")
```

Test to understand which commands are creating errors:


```{r, eval = F}
bookdown::render_book("book",
                      bookdown::pdf_book(pandoc_args = "--listings",
                                         latex_engine = "xelatex",
                                         biblio_style = "apalike",
                                         csl = "chicago-fullnote-bibliography.csl",
                                         includes = rmarkdown::includes(in_header = "preamble.tex"),
                                         documentclass = "book",
                                         sansfont = "Georgia",
                                         monofont = "Andale Mono",
                                         highlight = "pygments"))


```

`citation_package = "natbib"` throws an ugly error, and ends up removing all references in the document.

Weirdly, fonts only change if they go in `index.Rmd`.

## `bs4_book`

```{r, eval = F}
bookdown::render_book("book",
                      bookdown::bs4_book(css = "style.css",
                                         theme = list("primary" = "#52002E"),
                                         repo = list("base" = "https://github.com/brettellebi/PhD-thesis",
                                                                                         "branch" = "master", "subdir" = "book"),
                                         includes = rmarkdown::includes(in_header = "css.html"),
                                         footnotes_inline = T,
                                         bibliography = "book.bib"))
```


This is a *sample* book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports; for example, a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

## Usage

Each **bookdown** chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter *must* start with a first-level heading: `# A good chapter`, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading.

Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: `## A short section` or `### An even shorter section`.

The `index.Rmd` file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book.

## Render book

You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything:

1.  Find the **Build** pane in the RStudio IDE, and

2.  Click on **Build Book**, then select your output format, or select "All formats" if you'd like to use multiple formats from the same book source files.

Or build the book from the R console:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book()
```

To render this example to PDF as a `bookdown::pdf_book`, you'll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.org/tinytex/>.

## Preview book

As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in "Preview book", or from the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
