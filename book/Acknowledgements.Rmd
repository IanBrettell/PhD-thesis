I owe much to those who have guided me through this incredible life.

To my grandparents, U.N. and Shanta, who helped raise me and continue to offer wisdom, inspiration, and laughs (in varying proportions). And to my dear Granny, Bizz, I wish you were still here.

To my dad, Richard, who instilled in us such strong values without ever imposing them, and set up the template for my scientific trajectory. Your love for nature and the quirky side of life has been infectious. Thank you for proof-reading this thesis and picking up on inaccuracies like how Mendel's F~1~ generation was actually self-pollinated rather than inter-crossed! And to my mum, Rina, who has given me so much support and encouragement, and her partner Wayne for making great jokes and reminding me never to take things too seriously.

To my siblings, Rohan and Vanessa, it's been incredible to see you both develop into such beautiful, strong people. 

To my friends -- too many to name here, but you know who you are -- you're the *best* and I love you. A special thanks to the Pembroke crew (David, Annika, Emilie, Boris, Max, Katharina, Karen, Campbell, Ali and Luke) for making my (limited) time here an absolute blast, and Emilie and Luke -- let's keep our Pembroke Genome Project going virtually.

To John and Jenny, thank you for everything you've done for me.

To my gorgeous fianc√©e Charlotte, thank you for your faith, love and support. I look forward to continuing on our beautiful journey together.

To the staff of Pembroke College, you've made it feel like home. 

To the wider network at EMBL and EBI, I'm so grateful to have been a part of the International PhD program. The funding, resources, and introductory course were all fantastic, and I never wanted for anything.

To the Birney Research Group and our wider set of collaborators, it's been wonderful working with you, and I'm excited to see all the amazing science (or whatever else) you'll do throughout your careers. A special thank you to Tom Fitzgerald, for your constant and reassuring presence. 

To my Thesis Advisory Committee -- Virginie Uhlmann, Cornelius Gross, and Anne Ferguson-Smith -- thank you for your sage guidance throughout this process.

And finally, to the big dog himself, Ewan Birney -- you've been the best supervisor I could have hoped for. Extraordinarily generous and infinitely knowledgeable (at least from where I'm standing), you're an inspiration and a delight. Thank you.
