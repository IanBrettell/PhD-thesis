We find that D is unreliable in this situation as it gives inflated values when effective population size is low, causing D outliers to cluster in genomic regions of reduced diversity. As an alternative, we propose a related statistic f\^d, a modified version of a statistic originally developed to estimate the genome-wide fraction of admixture. f\^d is not subject to the same biases as D, and is better at identifying introgressed loci. Finally, we show that both D and f\^d outliers tend to cluster in regions of low absolute divergence (dXY), which can confound a recently proposed test for differentiating introgression from shared ancestral variation at individual loci.},

We explored these issues by genotyping 157 predicted SNPs in duplicons and control regions in normal diploid genomes and fully homozygous complete hydatidiform moles. Our data identified many true SNPs in duplicon regions and few paralogous sequence variants. Twenty-eight percent of the polymorphic duplicon sequences we tested involved multisite variation, a new type of polymorphism representing the sum of the signals from many individual duplicon copies that vary in sequence content due to duplication, deletion or gene conversion. Multisite variations can masquerade as normal SNPs when genotyped. Given that duplicons comprise at least 5\% of the genome and many are yet to be annotated in the genome draft, effective strategies to identify multisite variation must be established and deployed.},

  abstract = {Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, are already revolutionizing our understanding of genetic variation among individuals. However, the massive data sets generated by NGS—the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases—make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

Here we report completion of the project, having reconstructed the genomes of 2,504 individuals from 26 populations using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, deep exome sequencing, and dense microarray genotyping. We characterized a broad spectrum of genetic variation, in total over 88 million variants (84.7 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 3.6 million short insertions/deletions (indels), and 60,000 structural variants), all phased onto high-quality haplotypes. This resource includes {$>$}99\% of SNP variants with a frequency of {$>$}1\% for a variety of ancestries. We describe the distribution of genetic variation across the global sample, and discuss the implications for common disease studies., Results for the final phase of the 1000 Genomes Project are presented including whole-genome sequencing, targeted exome sequencing, and genotyping on high-density SNP arrays for 2,504 individuals across 26 populations, providing a global reference data set to support biomedical genetics., The 1000 Genomes Project has sought to comprehensively catalogue human genetic variation across populations, providing a valuable public genomic resource. The data obtained so far have found applications ranging from association studies and fine mapping studies to the filtering of likely neutral variants in rare-disease cohorts. The authors now report on the final phase of the project, phase 3, which covers previously uncharacterized areas of human genetic diversity in terms of the populations sampled and categories of characterized variation. The sample now includes more than 2,500 individuals from 26 global populations, with low coverage whole-genome and deep exome sequencing, as well as dense microarray genotyping. They find that while most common variants are shared across populations, rarer variants are often restricted to closely related populations. The authors also demonstrate the use of the phase 3 dataset as a reference panel for imputation to improve the resolution in genetic association studies.},

In crop plants, these include genes involved in domestication traits, such as those related to plant architecture, fruit and seed structure and morphology, as well as yield and quality traits improved by subsequent crop breeding. In wild plants, comparable traits have been dissected mainly in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this review, we discuss the major contributions of the analysis of natural variation to our understanding of plant development and physiology, focusing in particular on the timing of germination and flowering, plant growth and morphology, primary metabolism, and mineral accumulation. Overall, functional polymorphisms appear in all types of genes and gene regions, and they may have multiple mutational causes. However, understanding this diversity in relation to adaptation and environmental variation is a challenge for which tools are now available.},

The large amount of quantitative genetic variation, lack of population structure, and rapid local decay of linkage disequilibrium in the DGRP and outbred populations derived from DGRP lines present a favorable scenario for performing genome-wide association (GWA) mapping analyses to identify candidate causal genes, polymorphisms, and pathways affecting quantitative traits. The many GWA studies utilizing the DGRP have revealed substantial natural genetic variation for all reported traits, little evidence for variants with large effects but enrichment for variants with low P-values, and a tendency for lower frequency variants to have larger effects than more common variants. The variants detected in the GWA analyses rarely overlap those discovered using mutagenesis, and often are the first functional annotations of computationally predicted genes. Variants implicated in GWA analyses typically have sex-specific and genetic background-specific (epistatic) effects, as well as pleiotropic effects on other quantitative traits. Studies in the DGRP reveal substantial genetic control of environmental variation. Taking account of genetic architecture can greatly improve genomic prediction in the DGRP. These features of the genetic architecture of quantitative traits are likely to apply to other species, including humans.

  abstract = {We have developed an approach combining physiology and quantitative genetics to enhance our understanding of nitrogen (N) metabolism during kernel germination. The physiological study highlighted the central role of glutamine (Gln) synthetase (GS) and Gln synthesis during this developmental process because a concomitant increase of both the enzyme activity and the amino acid content was observed. This result suggests that Gln is acting either as a sink for ammonium released during both storage protein degradation and amino acid deamination or as a source for amino acid de novo synthesis by transamination. In the two parental lines used for the quantitative genetics approach, we found that the increase in Gln occurred earlier in Io compared with F2, a result consistent with its faster germinating capacity. The genetic study was carried out on 140 F6 recombinant inbred lines derived from the cross between F2 and Io. Quantitative trait locus mapping identified three quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to germination trait (T50, time at which 50\% of the kernels germinated) that explain 18.2\% of the phenotypic variance; three QTLs related to a trait linked to germination performance, kernel size/weight (thousand kernels weight), that explain 17\% of the phenotypic variance; two QTLs related to GS activity at early stages of germination that explain 17.7\% of the phenotypic variance; and one QTL related to GS activity at late stages of germination that explains 7.3\% of the phenotypic variance. Coincidences of QTL for germination efficiency and its components with genes encoding cytosolic GS (GS1) and the corresponding enzyme activity were detected, confirming the important role of the enzyme during the germination process. A triple colocalization on chromosome 4 betweengln3 (a structural gene encoding GS1) and a QTL for GS activity and T50 was found; whereas on chromosome 5, a QTL for GS activity and thousand kernels weight colocalized withgln4, another structural gene encoding GS1. This observation suggests that for each gene, the corresponding enzyme activity is of major importance for germination efficiency either through the size of the grain or through its faster germinating capacity. Consistent with the possible nonoverlapping function of the two GS1 genes, we found that in the parental line Io, the expression ofGln3 was transiently enhanced during the first hours of germination, whereas that of gln4 was constitutive.},

Crosses between these two gene pools potentially provide a source of additional genetic diversity but their progenies have been characterized by phenotypic abnormalities and reduced productivity. In order to gain additional insights into this problem, we examined the segregation for performance in two recombinant inbred populations (RIPs) resulting from Mesoamerican × Andean crosses in three contrasting environments and two years. The two RIPs – ‘California Dark Red Kidney’ (of Andean origin) × ‘Yolano’ (Mesoamerican), n = 150, and A55 (Mesoamerican) × G122 (Andean), n = 67 – were grown in replicated field tests to assess the agronomic performance of each recombinant inbred line. Both populations exhibited, on average, greater days to maturity (DTM), lower biomass growth rate (above-ground dry weight/DTM), lower economic growth rate (seed yield/DTM), and lesser harvest index. In contrast with the conclusions of earlier experiments, there was no evidence from the field trials for a genetic association (due to linkage or pleiotropy) between seed weight and economic growth rate, but there may be a genetic association between seed weight and life cycle length. We compare the results of these studies with earlier experiments on inter-gene pool recombinant populations of common beans and relate our observations of diminished performance to models of speciation mechanisms.},

  abstract = {The JAX Diversity Outbred population is a new mouse resource derived from partially inbred Collaborative Cross strains and maintained by randomized outcrossing. As such, it segregates the same allelic variants as the Collaborative Cross but embeds these in a distinct population architecture in which each animal has a high degree of heterozygosity and carries a unique combination of alleles. Phenotypic diversity is striking and often divergent from phenotypes seen in the founder strains of the Collaborative Cross. Allele frequencies and recombination density in early generations of Diversity Outbred mice are consistent with expectations based on simulations of the mating design. We describe analytical methods for genetic mapping using this resource and demonstrate the power and high mapping resolution achieved with this population by mapping a serum cholesterol trait to a 2-Mb region on chromosome 3 containing only 11 genes. Analysis of the estimated allele effects in conjunction with complete genome sequence data of the founder strains reduced the pool of candidate polymorphisms to seven SNPs, five of which are located in an intergenic region upstream of the Foxo1 gene.},

  abstract = {The mouse is the most extensively used mammalian model for biomedical and aging research, and an extensive catalogue of laboratory resources is available to support research using mice: classical inbred lines, genetically modified mice (knockouts, transgenics, and humanized mice), selectively bred lines, consomics, congenics, recombinant inbred panels, outbred and heterogeneous stocks, and an expanding set of wild-derived strains. However, these resources were not designed or intended to model the heterogeneous human population or for a systematic analysis of phenotypic effects due to random combinations of uniformly distributed natural variants. The Collaborative Cross (CC) is a large panel of recently established multiparental recombinant inbred mouse lines specifically designed to overcome the limitations of existing mouse genetic resources for analysis of phenotypes caused by combinatorial allele effects. The CC models the complexity of the human genome and supports analyses of common human diseases with complex etiologies originating through interactions between allele combinations and the environment. The CC is the only mammalian resource that has high and uniform genomewide genetic variation effectively randomized across a large, heterogeneous, and infinitely reproducible population. The CC supports data integration across environmental and biological perturbations and across space (different labs) and time.},

  abstract = {Medaka is a model organism in medicine, genetics, developmental biology and population genetics. Lab stocks composed of more than 100 local wild populations are available for research in these fields. Thus, medaka represents a potentially excellent bioresource for screening disease-risk- and adaptation-related genes in genome-wide association studies. Although the genetic population structure should be known before performing such an analysis, a comprehensive study on the genome-wide diversity of wild medaka populations has not been performed. Here, we performed genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) for 81 and 12 medakas captured from a bioresource and the wild, respectively. Based on the GBS data, we evaluated the genetic population structure and estimated the demographic parameters using an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework. The genome-wide data confirmed that there were substantial differences between local populations and supported our previously proposed hypothesis on medaka dispersal based on mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) data. A new finding was that a local group that was thought to be a hybrid between the northern and the southern Japanese groups was actually an origin of the northern Japanese group. Thus, this paper presents the first population-genomic study of medaka and reveals its population structure and history based on chromosomal genetic diversity.},

Without these data, we can only speculate about evolutionary processes that underlie trait variation. Here, we review how quantitative and molecular genetics in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans led to the discovery and validation of 37 quantitative trait genes over the past 15 years. Using these data, we can start to make inferences about evolution from these quantitative trait genes, including the roles that coding versus noncoding variation, gene family expansion, common versus rare variants, pleiotropy, and epistasis play in trait variation across this species.},
