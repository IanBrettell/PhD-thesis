# Chapter 2 supplementary information

(ref:nuc-div-per-indiv) Nucleotide diversity ($\hat{\pi}$) calculated within 500-kb non-overlapping windows for each of the 63 non-"sibling" lines from the MIKK panel individually, for chromosome 1 (left) and 22 (right). The windows that include the medaka sex determination region (1:~16-17 Mb) show consistent elevated nucleotide diversity across most lines.

## 15 HMM states with 0.05 second interval

(ref:hmm-states-05) HMM states predicted for the F0 dataset, using the combination of a 0.05-second interval between which the distance and angle variables were calculated.
