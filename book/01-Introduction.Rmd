# Introduction

## A brief history of genetics

### Ancient Greece

Humankind has long sought to understand the basis of biological variation. What gives rise to the wondrous variety of life forms on Earth? Why do individuals of a particular species differ from one another? How do children inherit traits that are similar to those of their parents, yet on the whole remain distinct from both their parents and their siblings? And are the traits we care about -- our health, our intelligence, our ability to thrive in a changing world -- pre-determined from birth, or continuously pliable throughout our lives? 

Around 500 BC, the Ancient Grecian Pythagoras applied his understanding of triangles to this question, proposing the theory known as "spermism". He posited that  hereditary information was passed down from parent to child via male sperm, with the female only providing the nutrients that would allow it to grow, and, like the theorem that bears his name, that these two sides of the "triangle" the length of the third side: the characteristics of the child [@mukherjeeGeneIntimateHistory2016].

Over a century later, in 380 BC, Plato extended this metaphor in *The Republic* to argue that this principle could be applied to perfect humanity, by breeding perfect combinations of parents. 

Aristotle joined the discussion with his treatise *Generation of Animals*, where he noted cases where human skin colour and other traits could skip generations, and thus hereditary information must not only be transmitted through sperm. He suggested an idea of "movement" -- the transmission of information -- from the father's sperm, which sculpts the mother's menstrual blood in the same way a carpenter carves a piece of wood.[@mukherjeeGeneIntimateHistory2016]

### Medieval times

In medieval times, the prevailing theory was that a tiny human -- a homunculus -- sat within the sperm, waiting to be inflated upon its introduction to a woman's uterus. However, this would require a homunculus to sit within another homunculus, *ad infinitum*, like Matryoshka dolls, all the way back to the Biblical first man, Adam. Even the inventor of the microscope, Nicolaas Hartsoeker, thought he saw one in a sperm he was studying.

### Charles Darwin and Gregor Mendel

In 1831, a young Charles Darwin boarded the HMS *Beagle* to embark on an expedition to collect specimens from South America. After collecting a huge number of fossils from the along the eastern coast and shipping them back to England, the *Beagle* spent 5 weeks touring through the 18 volcanic islands of the Gal√†pagos, where Darwin collected
