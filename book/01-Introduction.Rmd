## A brief history of genetics

Humankind has long sought to understand the basis of biological variation. What gives rise to the wondrous variety of life forms on Earth? Why do individuals of a particular species differ from one another? How do children inherit traits that are similar to those of their parents, yet on the whole remain distinct from both their parents and their siblings? And are the traits we care about -- our health, our intelligence, our ability to thrive in a changing world -- pre-determined from birth, or continuously pliable throughout our lives? 

### Ancient Greece

Around 500 BC, the Ancient Grecian Pythagoras applied his understanding of triangles to this question, proposing the theory known as "spermism". He posited that hereditary information was passed down from parent to child via male sperm, with the female only providing the nutrients that would allow it to grow, and, like the theorem that bears his name, that these two sides of the "triangle" would determine the length of the third side: the characteristics of the child [@mukherjeeGeneIntimateHistory2016].

Over a century later, in 380 BC, Plato extended this metaphor in *The Republic* to argue that this principle could be applied in order to perfect humanity, by breeding perfect combinations of parents at perfect times. 

Aristotle joined the discussion with his treatise *Generation of Animals*, where he noted that children inherited features from their mothers as well as their fathers, and raised cases where human skin colour and other traits could skip generations, and thus hereditary information must not only be transmitted through sperm. He suggested an idea of "movement" -- the transmission of information -- from the father's sperm, which sculpts the mother's menstrual blood in the same way a carpenter carves a piece of wood [@mukherjeeGeneIntimateHistory2016]. Aristotle, however, could not deduce the form in which the information was conveyed.

### Medieval times

In medieval times, the prevailing theory was that a tiny human -- a homunculus -- sat within the sperm, waiting to be inflated upon its introduction to a woman's uterus. However, this would require a homunculus to sit within another homunculus, *ad infinitum*, like Matryoshka dolls, all the way back to the Biblical first man, Adam. Even the inventor of the microscope, Nicolaas Hartsoeker, thought he saw one in a sperm he was studying. But what then triggered the expansion of the human form, involving the development of new parts from embryo to fetus? The answer could only have been some instruction, blueprint, or code, but any specifics were out of reach.

### Mendel

In 1831, Charles Darwin boarded the

### Charles Darwin and Gregor Mendel

In 1831, a young Charles Darwin boarded the HMS *Beagle* to embark on an expedition to collect specimens from South America. After collecting a huge number of fossils from the along the eastern coast and shipping them back to England, the *Beagle* spent 5 weeks touring through the 18 volcanic islands of the Gal√†pagos, where Darwin collected

## Mixed models for genetic association analysis

"The distinction between Mendelian loci and QTLs is artificial, as the same mapping techniques can be applied to both. In fact, the classification of genetic (and allelic) effects should be considered as a continuum. At one end of the spectrum is the dichotomous Mendelian trait with only two detectable and distinct phenotypes, which are governed by a single gene. At the other end are traits, such as growth, which are likely to be affected by many genes that each contribute a small portion to the overall phenotype." [@membersofthecomplextraitconsortiumNatureIdentificationQuantitative2003]

Since it became possible to sequence the genotypes of individuals at scale, it has been an ongoing point of debate as to how best to model the effects that genetic variants have on a trait of interest.

Population structure and unequal relatedness among individuals in a given cohort can lead to false discoveries [@ewensTransmissionDisequilibriumTest1995; @membersofthecomplextraitconsortiumNatureIdentificationQuantitative2003]. This is because individuals who share common ancestries will share both variants that do affect the trait of interest, and variants that do not, and these variants will be correlated with one other due to that shared ancestry. Therefore, if an association is found between the causal variants and a trait of interest, the non-causal variants that are correlated with the causal variants will also be found to be statistically associated with the trait.

How then does one control for population structure? 

Three methods were formerly used [@zhangMixedLinearModel2010]: 

1. Structured association [@pritchardInferencePopulationStructure2000]

1. Genomic control [@devlinGenomicControlAssociation1999]

1. Family-based tests of association [@abecasisGeneralTestAssociation2000]

"Ronald fished introduced random effects models to study the correlations of trait values between relatives" [@fisherXVCorrelationRelatives1919].

## Somites

Vertebral number is precisely defined for a given species [@gomezControlSegmentNumber2008], but is the most variable physical trait across species [@kimuraGeneticAnalysisVertebral2012]; for example, frogs have 6-10, humans have 33, and snakes can have more than 300 [@gomezControlSegmentNumber2008; @kimuraGeneticAnalysisVertebral2012]. The total number of vertebrae is a function of both how long the somite segmentation process persists for, and the
