# Genomic variations in the MIKK panel {#MIKK-genomes-chap}^[This project was carried out in collaboration with Felix Loosli's group at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), and Joachim Wittbrodt's group in the Centre for Organismal Studies (COS) at the University of Heidelberg. This chapter sets out my contributions to @fitzgeraldMedakaInbredKiyosuKarlsruhe2022 and @legerGenomicVariationsEpigenomic2022, which were published as companion papers in the journal *Genome Biology* to introduce the MIKK panel to the scientific community, and describe the genetic characteristics of the MIKK panel that would make it a useful resource for other researchers who wish to explore the genetics of quantitative traits in vertebrates. I am joint-first author on both papers.]

## The Medaka Inbred Kiyosu-Karlruhe (MIKK) panel

Having introduced the MIKK panel in section \@ref(MIKK-background) of the previous chapter, I now describe certain genomic characteristics of the MIKK panel that are relevant to its utility for the genetic mapping of complex traits. This includes visualising the inbreeding trajectory of the panel (section \@ref(inbreeding-sec)), exploring the evolutionary history of the MIKK panel's founding population (section \@ref(introgression-sec)), measuring the levels of homozygosity across the panel (section \@ref(nuc-div)), assessing its allele-frequency distribution and rate of linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay (section \@ref(ld-decay-sec)), and characterising the structural variants present in a smaller sample of lines using Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing data (section \@ref(mikksv-sec)).

## Genomic characterisation of the MIKK panel

### MIKK panel DNA sequence dataset {#non-sib-calls}

For the preparation of @fitzgeraldMedakaInbredKiyosuKarlsruhe2022, 79 of the 80 extant MIKK panel lines -- together with several wild Kiyosu samples and individuals from the established *iCab* medaka strain -- had their DNA sequenced from brain samples using Illumina short-read sequencing technology. Tomas Fitzgerald from the Birney Group at EMBL-EBI then aligned these sequences to the *HdrR* medaka reference and called variants to produce the **MIKK Illumina call set** in the form of a .vcf file containing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and small insertion-deletion (INDEL) calls for each line. To avoid allele frequency biases introduced by the 16 pairs/triplets of "sibling lines" (see \@ref(inbreeding-sec)), I removed each pairâ€™s arbitrarily-labelled second sibling line from the variant call set, leaving 63 MIKK panel lines (**MIKK non-sibling call set**), and used only those calls for the analyses in Chapters \@ref(nuc-div) and \@ref(ld-decay-sec).

For the preparation of @legerGenomicVariationsEpigenomic2022, 12 MIKK panel lines had their DNA sequenced from brain samples using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing technology. Adrien Leger from the Birney Group at EMBL-EBI then aligned these sequences to the *HdrR* medaka reference, and called variants to produce the **MIKK ONT call set** in the form of a .vcf file containing structural variants calls for each line with tags for insertions (INS), deletions (DEL), duplications (SUP), inversions (INV) and translocations (TRA). The work described below used these variant call sets as the primary datasets.

### Assessing the inbreeding trajectory of the MIKK panel {#inbreeding-sec}

The MIKK panel was bred from a wild population of medaka found in the Kiyosu area near Toyohashi, Aichi Prefecture, in southern Japan.[@spivakovGenomicPhenotypicCharacterization2014] From this wild population, the Loosli Group at KIT set up random crosses of single mating pairs to create 115 'founder families'. For each founder family, they then set up between two and five single full-sibling-pair inbreeding crosses, which resulted in 253 F1 lines. Lines derived from the same founder family are referred to as 'sibling lines'. Over the course of the next eight generations of inbreeding, they used only one mating pair per line. I generated **Fig. \@ref(fig:InbreedingFigure)A** and **B** from the inbreeding data provided by the Loosli Group. **Fig. \@ref(fig:InbreedingFigure)A** shows the number of lines that survived over the course of the first 14 generations of the inbreeding program, and the various causes for the termination of other lines. **Fig. \@ref(fig:InbreedingFigure)B** shows the average fecundity levels of the surviving lines at generation F16. In addition, the Birney Group at EMBL-EBI generated morphometric data for the MIKK panel lines to demonstrate the distribution of physical phenotypes across the MIKK panel. I used this data on relative eye diameters to generate **Fig. \@ref(fig:InbreedingFigure)C**.

(ref:InbreedingFigure) Inbreeding, fecundity and eye size in the MIKK panel lines. **A**: Status of all MIKK panel lines during the first 14 generations of inbreeding, showing cause of death for non-extant lines. **B**: Average fecundity of MIKK panel lines in generation F16, as measured during peak egg production in July 2020. **C**: Distribution of mean relative eye size for female and male medaka across all MIKK panel lines.

### Introgression with northern Japanese and Korean medaka populations {#introgression-sec}

To explore the evolutionary history of the MIKK panel's founding population, we sought to determine whether there was evidence of introgression between that southern Japanese population, and northern Japanese and Korean medaka populations. To this end, I used the 50-fish multiple alignment from Ensembl release 102 to obtain the aligned genome sequences for the established medaka inbred lines *HdrR* (southern Japan), *HNI* (northern Japan), and *HSOK* (Korea), as well as the most recent common ancestor of all three strains.[@IndexPubRelease102] Using the phylogenetic tree provided with the dataset, and the *ape* R package,[@paradisApeEnvironmentModern2019] I identified the most recent common ancestor of those three strains. For each locus with a non-missing base for *HdrR*, I assigned the allele in that ancestral sequence as the 'ancestral' allele, and the alternative allele as the 'derived' allele, and then combined that dataset with the MIKK Illumina call set and variant calls for the southern Japanese *iCab* strain (see \@ref(non-sib-calls)). 

I then carried out an ABBA BABA analysis to calculate a modified 'admixture proportion' statistic $\hat{f}_d$[@martinEvaluatingUseABBA2015] as a measure of the proportion of shared genome in 500-kb sliding windows between the MIKK panel and either *iCab*, *HNI*, or *HSOK* (**Fig. \@ref(fig:ABBABABA)**), using the scripts provided by the first author of @martinEvaluatingUseABBA2015 on their GitHub page.[@martinSimonhmartinGenomicsGeneral2022]

(ref:ABBABABA) **Figure 2**: ABBA-BABA analysis. **A**. Phylogenetic tree generated from the Ensembl release 102 50-fish multiple alignment, showing only the medaka lines used in the ABBA-BABA analysis. **B**. Schema of the comparisons carried out in the ABBA-BABA analysis. **C**. Circos plot comparing introgression ($\hat{f}_d$) between the MIKK panel and either *iCab* (yellow), *HNI* (orange), or *HSOK* (purple), calculated within 500-kb sliding windows using a minimum of 250 SNPs per window.

```{r ABBABABA, echo = F, fig.cap = '(ref:ABBABABA)', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("book/figs/mikk_genome/07_introgression.png"))
```

Based on the genome-wide mean $\hat{f}_d$, the MIKK panel shares approximately 25% of its genome with *iCab*, 9% with *HNI*, and 12% with *HSOK*. These results provide evidence that the MIKK panel's originating population has more recently introgressed with medaka from Korea than with medaka from northern Japan. This supports the findings in @spivakovGenomicPhenotypicCharacterization2014, where the authors found little evidence of significant interbreeding between southern and northern Japanese medaka since the populations diverged. Although the proportional difference between *HNI* and *HSOK* is small, this further supports the general finding that northern and southern Japanese medaka strains show low levels of interbreeding that may be a result of geographical isolation or genome divergence.[@katsumuraMedakaPopulationGenome2019]

### Nucleotide diversity {#nuc-div}

As a  means of assessing genetic diversity in the MIKK panel, I calculated nucleotide diversity ($\hat{\pi}$) within 500-kb non-overlapping windows across the genome of the 63 lines in the MIKK non-sibling call set (see \@ref(non-sib-calls)), and compared this to the nucleotide diversity in 7 wild medaka from the same Kiyosu population from which the MIKK panel was derived. Mean and median nucleotide diversity in both the MIKK panel and wild Kiyosu medaka were close to 0, and slightly higher in the MIKK panel (mean: MIKK = 0.0038, wild = 0.0037; median: MIKK = 0.0033, wild = 0.0031). The patterns of varying nucleotide diversity across the genome are shared between the MIKK panel and wild Kiyosu medaka, where regions with high levels of repeat content tend to have higher nucleotide diversity (r = 0.386, p \< 0.001) (**Fig. \@ref(fig:NucleotideDiversity)**). I also calculated $\hat{\pi}$ for each line individually, and as expected, levels of $\hat{\pi}$ around the (XX/XY) sex determination region of 1:~16-17 Mb are elevated in all lines relative to the consistently low levels found in most other chromosomes.

(ref:NucleotideDiversity) Circos plot with nucleotide diversity ($\hat{\pi}$) calculated within 500-kb non-overlapping windows for 63 non-sibling lines from the MIKK panel (*green*) and 7 wild Kiyosu medaka samples from the same originating population (*purple*); proportion of sequence classified as repeats by RepeatMasker (*blue*); and mean mapping quality (*pink*).

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("book/figs/mikk_genome/supp_01_pi_circos.png"))
```

The higher level of $\hat{\pi}$ observed within specific regions on several chromosomes -- such as chromosomes 2, 11, and 18 -- correspond closely to the regions we identified as containing large (>250 kb) inversions that appear to be shared across at least some of the MIKK panel (**Fig. \@ref(fig:SVInvs)**). These regions are also enriched for large deletions and duplications.[@legerGenomicVariationsEpigenomic2022] Inversions cause permanent heterozygosity [@hoffmannChromosomalInversionPolymorphisms2004], and duplications and deletions may have increased the density of called SNPs in these regions [@fredmanComplexSNPrelatedSequence2004], so the observed depressions in homozygosity at these loci may be the result of such large structural variants that are present in the MIKK panel's genomes.

Overall, this analysis confirms that the MIKK panel shows similar levels of homozygosity compared to classical laboratory inbred medaka strains, and possesses a strong increase in isogenic genotypes compared to wild medaka from the original wild population.

```

### LD decay {#ld-decay-sec}

I analysed the MIKK panel's allele frequency distribution and linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure to assess their likely effects on genetic mapping. To remove allele-frequency biases introduced by the presence of sibling lines in the MIKK panel, I used only the MIKK non-sibling call set (see Chapter \@ref(non-sib-calls)). 

To assess how accurately one may be able to map genetic variants using the MIKK panel relative to a human dataset, I compared the MIKK panelâ€™s minor allele frequency (MAF) distribution and LD structure against that of the 2,504 humans in the 1KG Phase 3 release.[@GlobalReferenceHuman2015] To prepare the **"1KG call set"**, I first downloaded the .vcf files for each autosome from the projectâ€™s FTP site (ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/), then merged them into a single VCF using GATK.[@mckennaGenomeAnalysisToolkit2010] I then used PLINK[@changSecondgenerationPLINKRising2015; @purcellPLINK] to calculate the minor allele frequencies for all non-missing, biallelic SNPs in both the MIKK non-sibling and IKG call sets (*N* SNPs = 16,395,558 and 81,042,381 respectively) (**Fig. \@ref(fig:LDdecay)A**). As expected, the 1KG and MIKK panel calls are similarly enriched for low-frequency variants, albeit to a lesser extent in the MIKK panel, which is likely due to its smaller sample size.

To determine the rate of LD decay in the MIKK panel and compare it to that in the 1KG sample, for both the MIKK non-sibling and 1KG call sets, I used PLINK to compute $r^2$ on each autosome for all pairs of non-missing, biallelic SNPs with MAF $>$ 0.10 within 10 kb of one another (for 1KG and the MIKK panel respectively ~ 5.5M and ~ 3M SNPs, with a total number of pairwise $r^2$ observations of 204,152,922 and 146,785,673). I then grouped the $r^2$ observations for each pair of SNPs based on their distance from one another into non-overlapping bins of 100 bp in length, and calculated the mean $r^2$ in each of those bins to generate **Fig. \@ref(fig:LDdecay)B** using the mean $r^2$ and left boundary of each bin.

(ref:LDdecay) Minor allele frequency distributions and LD decay for biallelic, non-missing SNPs in the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 variant calls (N = 2,504) (1KG), and the MIKK panel Illumina-based calls excluding one of each pair of sibling lines (N = 63), across all autosomes (1KG: chrs 1-22; MIKK: chrs 1-24). **A**: Histogram of allele frequencies in the 1KG and MIKK panel calls. **B**: LD decay for each autosome, calculated by taking the mean $r^2$ of pairs of SNPs with MAF $>$ 0.1 within non-overlapping 100 bp windows of distance from one another, up to a maximum of 10 kb. LD decays faster on chromosome 2 for the MIKK panel due to its higher recombination rate.

```{r LDdecay, echo = F, fig.cap = '(ref:LDdecay)', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("book/figs/mikk_genome/08_ld_decay.png"))
```

Based on the 1KG calls under these parameters, LD decays in humans to a mean $r^2$ of around 0.2-0.35 at a distance of 10 kb, whereas the MIKK panel reaches this level within 1 kb, with a mean $r^2$ of 0.3-0.4 at a distance of ~100 bp. This implies that when a causal variant is present in at least two lines in the MIKK panel, one may be able to map causal variants at a higher resolution than in humans. We note that LD decays faster in chromosome 2 of the MIKK panel relative to the other chromosomes. This suggests that it has a much higher recombination rate, which is consistent with the linkage map described in @naruseDetailedLinkageMap2000, showing a higher genetic distance per Mb for this chromosome. This higher recombination rate in chromosome 2 may in turn be caused by its relatively high proportion of repeat content (**Fig. \@ref(fig:repeats)**).

## Structural variation in the MIKK panel {#mikksv-sec}

As an alternative to the variation pangenome approach described in @legerGenomicVariationsEpigenomic2022, I explored the structural variants (SVs) present in 9 of the MIKK panel lines in a reference-anchored manner, similar to many human studies. Differences in SVs between panel lines is another important class of genetic variation that could cause or contribute to significant phenotypic differences. Here we used ONT data obtained for 9 of the 12 selected lines allowing us to characterise larger SVs in the MIKK panel and to create a more extensive picture of genomic rearrangements compared to available medaka reference genomes. Adrien Leger from the Birney Group at EMBL-EBI first called structural variants using only the ONT long reads, producing a set of structural variants classified into five types: deletions (DEL), insertions (INS), translocations (TRA), duplications (DUP) and inversions (INV). I then "polished" the called DEL and INS variants with Illumina short reads to improve their accuracy. The polishing process filtered out 7.4% of DEL and 12.8% of INS variants, and adjusted the breakpoints (i.e. start and end positions) for 75-77% of DEL and INS variants in each sample by a mean of 23 bp for the start position, and 33 bp for the end position. This process produced a total of 143,326 filtered SVs.

The 9 "polished" samples contained a mean per-sample count of approximately 37K DEL variants (12% singletons), 29.5K INS variants (14%), 3.5K TRA variants (9%), 2.5K DUP (7%) and 600 INV (7%) (**Fig. \@ref(fig:SV-main)D**). DEL variants were up to 494 kb in length, with 90% of unique DEL variants shorter than 3.8 kb. INS variants were only up to 13.8 kb in length, with 90% of unique INS variants shorter than 2 kb. DUP and INV variants tended to be longer, with a mean length of 19 and 70.5 kb respectively (**Fig. \@ref(fig:SV-main)A**). **Fig. \@ref(fig:SV-main)E** shows the per-sample distribution of DEL variants across the genome. Most large DEL variants over 250 kb in length were common among the MIKK panel lines. A number of large DEL variants appear to have accumulated within the 0-10 Mb region of chromosome 2, which is enriched for repeats in the HdrR reference genome (**Fig. \@ref(fig:repeats)**).

SVs were generally enriched in regions covered by repeats. While only 16% of bases in the *HdrR* reference were classified as repeats (irrespective of strand), those bases overlapped with 72% of DEL, 63% of DUP, 81% of INV and 35% of TRA variant regions. However, repeat bases only overlapped with 21% of INS variants. We also assessed each SV's probability of being loss-of-function (pLI)[@lekAnalysisProteincodingGenetic2016] by calculating the logarithm of odds (LOD) for the pLI scores of all genes overlapping the variant (**Fig. \@ref(fig:SV-main)B,C**). 30,357 out of 134,088 DEL, INS, DUP and INV variants overlapped at least one gene, and 9% of those had a score greater than 10, indicating a high probability that the SV would cause a loss of function. Two INS variants on chr2 had an outlying LOD score of 57 as a result of overlapping medaka gene ENSORLG00000003411, which has a pLI score of 1 -- the highest intolerance to variants causing a loss of function. This gene is homologous with human genes *SCN1A*, *SCN2A* and *SCN3A*, which encode sodium channels and have been associated with neuronal and sleep disorders. We did not find evidence that longer SVs tended to have a higher probability of causing a loss of function (**Fig. \@ref(fig:SV-main)B**).

```

We compared these polished INS and DEL calls with the high-quality graph-based alternative paths and large-scale deletions, respectively (see section titled *Novel genetic sequences and large-scale insertions and deletions in the MIKK panel* in @legerGenomicVariationsEpigenomic2022). We found that 2 of the 19 regions covered by graph-based alternative paths, and 4 of the 16 regions covered by graph-based deletions, had no SVs that overlapped those regions at all, which suggests they would have been missed entirely when using a reference-anchored approach alone.

With the exception of one alternative path on chromosome 20, the alternative paths were not captured by INS variants, which only covered up to 63% of the bases in each region, and in many cases substantially less. On the other hand, for 8 of the 16 graph-based deletions, the DEL variants covered at least 85% of the bases in those regions. The other 8 graph-based deletions were either not at all covered by DEL variants, or only slightly. This indicates that the reference-based approach is better at detecting large-scale deletions than alternative paths ("insertions"), but still misses around half of such variants relative to the graph-based approach.

## Conclusions

Taken together, these analyses show that the MIKK panel is highly homozygous, with LD characteristics that will favour high-resolution genetic mapping relative to humans. In the future, the SV analysis performed on a subset of the MIKK panel will be expanded across the entire panel, which will permit the inclusion of both large- and small-scale variants in genetic linkage studies. I proceeded to use the MIKK panel to analyse bold/shy behaviours, as I describe in Chapter \@ref(MIKK-F2-chap), with a view to carrying out an F2-cross linkage study to identify genetic variants associated with differences in the behaviours of an individual, and the extent to which they transmit those behaviours to their social companions. However, before carrying out this study, we first ran a "pilot" study on 5 previously-established inbred lines to validate our behavioural assay. This is the subject of the following chapter.
